We understand that Design Thinking is a human-centered
approach to innovation that draws from the designer's toolkit to
integrate the needs of people, the possibilities of technology,
and the requirements for business success.
It is a skill that allows a Designer to align what people want with
what can be done, and produce a viable business strategy that
creates customer value and market opportunity.The engineering
design process is a series of steps that engineers follow to come
up with a solution to a
problem. Many times the solution
involves designing a product that meets certain criteria and/or
accomplishes a certain task.
